"""Cookie (sp_dc) web-session backend for Spotify.

A self-hosted Spotify developer app in Development Mode is refused (403) by the
official API on the *content* surface — creating playlists and adding/removing
playlist items — even with the modify scopes granted. Reads already have a
web-player fallback (`spotify_web.py`); this is the matching path for writes.

It authenticates as Spotify's own first-party web client via the `sp_dc` cookie
(spotify_scraper mints the bearer, TOTP and all), which is not subject to the
dev-app gate. Item add/remove go through the web-player GraphQL API
("pathfinder"); playlist creation goes through Spotify's first-party playlist
service. When ``SPOTIFY_WRITE_BACKEND=cookie`` this module is a complete peer:
library listing, playlist reads, catalog search and writes all use the signed-in
web session. No Spotify developer Client ID, secret or Premium account is needed.

Fragility (why the self-heal exists): pathfinder persisted-query hashes rotate
on each web-player release and a stale one is rejected as PersistedQueryNotFound.
`_refresh_hashes` re-scrapes the current hashes from the live web-player bundle
on that error, so a rotation self-heals instead of hard-failing. The `sp_dc`
session can be revoked or rotated; the connector surfaces when it needs renewing.

      • OAuth user token → 403 on /tracks (dev-mode gate).
      • cookie (first-party) token → does batch, but rate-limits PER-ACCOUNT and, retried
        into a 429, escalates into an hours-long penalty box. Kept for WRITES, not this.
      • APP token → a SEPARATE rate bucket from the user account, so ISRC reads never touch
        the per-account limit. A DEV-MODE app 403s on batch and caps ~300/24h on single; an
        EXTENDED-QUOTA app does the 50-ids batch — a whole library in ~len/50 calls. The
        SPOTIFY_ISRC_CLIENTS pool supplies batch-capable app creds.

    Three outcomes per batch, and the distinction between the last two is the point:
      • 429 rotates to the next pool app; when the LAST app 429s it raises, so the sync
        fails closed rather than matching blind. No retry INTO a 429 on the same app
        (that's what earns a penalty box).
      • 403 means that app cannot serve this endpoint at all, which is not something a
        retry or a wait fixes. Every pool app is tried, then _isrc_singles carries the
        batch. A refused app must not take the sync down: an expired Premium on the
        pool app's owner account, or no extended-quota app at all, is a slower path,
        not a broken one.
